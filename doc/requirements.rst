Requirements
************

This guide is not a tutorial. Readers should be familiar with the command line
in general and btrfs in particular.

Throughout this guide we assume that a backup strategy based on btrfs is already
in place (e.g., using `btrbk`_). It is also a prerequisite that backups are
available on a separate file system (e.g. an external disk) or on a remote
system.
